## Installing the fs package on macOS

fs is a new package from Jim Hester that for managing files and
directories that I will use throughout the workshop.

The CRAN mirrors are currently having trouble with macOS binaries. If
you are on mac you can install the fs package with a binary that we
built:

```
url <- "https://github.com/jennybc/what-they-forgot/blob/master/fs_1.1.0.tgz?raw=true"
install.packages(url, repos = NULL, type = "binary")
```


## Fixing slow CRAN downloads

We have set up a local CRAN mirror for the RStudio conference. All
requests to `https://cran.rstudio.com/` are intercepted and redirected
to this local mirror in order to improve download speeds. Make sure
your default CRAN repo is set to the RStudio mirror (this is the
default if you use RStudio):

```
options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cran.rstudio.com/"))
```
